                    <h1>Is it worth using a Recruitment agency?</h1>
                    <p>Simply imagine, you're seeking for the assistance of someone who is aware and who is a
                        professional. Recruitment Agencies cooperate directly with Employer companies and usually they
                        have a much better understanding of specifics what an Employer is searching for.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Besides, they most probably know of Vacant Roles that you'd find difficult to find and learn
                        about on your own. Very often, that many Vacant Roles are not published in the internet or Job
                        platforms. What is more, Agency can also support you in becoming a better candidate and increase
                        your chances of getting a Job.</p>

                <div class="job-text">
                    <h1>Do I have to pay for Recruitment agency support? Is there a fee?</h1>
                    <p>Most often all costs and fees are covered by Employers who provide Vacancies and Jobs. But,
                        sometimes Job Seeker might be asked to cover some expenses connected with the recruitment
                        procedure or documents set up after a positive interview for example. In any case, we always try
                        to make it absolutely free for Candidates, so they can just mainly concentrate themselves on
                        interview preparation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Speaking in general, it is much more common nowadays, that Employers tend to foot the bill and
                        all expenses connected with recruitment.
